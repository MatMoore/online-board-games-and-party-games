# Online board games and party games
A list of games that can be played online with a group of friends.

## Voice chat suggestions
Many of these games assume you are using a seperate tool to chat. Here are some free tools you can use:

- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) - multiple text/voice channels that you can join and leave at any time
- [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) - a temporary video meeting with a shareable link, no need to install anything, but requires a google account to set up
- [House party](https://houseparty.com/) comes with a few games built in
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) - a temporary video meeting, easy for other people to join without signing up, but you may need to restart the call every 40 minutes

## Physical games that can be adapted for remote play
To adapt these games for remote play:

- use a camera to share publicly visible information (or hidden information before the game starts)
- the person with the camera can move pieces on behalf of the other players and read out information
- you can also share pictures/scans of things players need to read as part of the game in advance
- players may need to keep track of additional information themselves (e.g. on paper)
- you can label grids to make it easier for remote players to call out where they want to play
